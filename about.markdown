<h1>Contribution:</h1>

Both group members worked on all tasks together and helped each other. I we should state focus areas of our contribution, this would be the most accurate:

Responsibility of Manos:
- Working on Plot 1 and 2
- Researching and Testing alternative plots for the story
- Gathering background data for all texts

Responsibility of Nico:
- Working on Plot 3
- Github pages setup and structuring
- Gathering background data for all texts

Those contributions rather not indicate a higher workload of one or another person in a specific area, but just states the person responsible for delegating tasks and getting things done.
